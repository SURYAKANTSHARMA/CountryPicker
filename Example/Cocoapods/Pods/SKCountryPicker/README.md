## Installation

CountryPicker is available through Cocoapods and Carthage.

#### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):
Add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'SKCountryPicker'
```
Current version compatible with Swift 5.
If you want support Swift 4.1/3.3

```ruby
pod 'SKCountryPicker' '~> 1.2.0'
```

#### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
The steps required to use Carthage for dependency management are described [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started) but lets add them to this README as well for good measure.

First you need to add the following line to your Cartfile

```
github "SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker"
```

to include the latest version of CountryPicker.

(if you don't have a Cartfile, you need to create one first in your favorite texteditor)

Next run

```
carthage update --platform iOS
```

This will have Carthage:
- Fetch the source code for CountryPicker from Github
- Compile the source code into a framework for you to use

once Carthage finishes building, you need to add the framework to your project.

In Xcode:

- Navigate to the "General" tab of your project and tap the plus sign under "Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content"
- Select "Add other" and locate the Carthage folder (typically in the root of your project)
- The SKCountryPicker.framework is located under `Carthage/Build/iOS/`
- Select it and verify that it is added as a framework.

The final step is to add the `copy-frameworks` build script to your "Build Phases".

- Navigate to "Build Phases" and tap the + at the top.
- Select "New Run Script Phase"
- Paste this line as the script to run `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
- Add the SKCountryPicker.framework under Input Files like so: `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SKCountryPicker.framework`

Done!

#### [SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add the following line to your Package.swift file in the dependencies section:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker.git, from "1.2.7")
```

## Getting Started
Example:
Please  check [example](https://github.com/SURYAKANTSHARMA/CountryPicker/tree/master/Example) project for customization and different option available.
```swift
import UIKit
import SKCountryPicker
class ViewController: UIViewController  {
  //MARK:- IBOutlet
  @IBOutlet weak var countryCodeButton: UIButton!
  @IBOutlet weak var countryImageView: UIImageView!

  //MARK:- Func
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

    guard let country = CountryManager.shared.currentCountry else {
        self.countryCodeButton.setTitle("Pick Country", for: .normal)
        self.countryImageView.isHidden = true
        return
    }

    countryCodeButton.setTitle(country.dialingCode, for: .normal)
    countryImageView.image = country.flag
    countryCodeButton.clipsToBounds = true
  }


  @IBAction func countryCodeButtonClicked(_ sender: UIButton) {

    // Invoke below static method to present country picker without section control
    // CountryPickerController.presentController(on: self) { ... }

    let countryController = CountryPickerWithSectionViewController.presentController(on: self) { [weak self] (country: Country) in

      guard let self = self else { return }

      self.countryImageView.image = country.flag
      self.countryCodeButton.setTitle(country.dialingCode, for: .normal)

    }

    // can customize the countryPicker here e.g font and color
    countryController.detailColor = UIColor.red
   }
}
```

## Filter Options
There are 3 main filter options `countryName`, `countryCode`, `countryDialCode` and  by default country picker has been configured to filter countries based on `countryName`.

If you want to add/remove filter options, do as follows:
```swift

 // Adding filter
 CountryManager.shared.addFilter(.countryCode)

 // Removing filter
 CountryManager.shared.removeFilter(.countryCode)

 // Removing all filters
 CountryManager.shared.clearAllFilters()
```

Incase you want to retrieve  `country` info
```swift

// Get country based on digit code e.g: 60, +255
CountryManager.shared.country(withDigitCode: "255")

// Get country based on country name
CountryManager.shared.country(withName: "Tanzania")

// Get country based on country code e.g: MY, TZ
CountryManager.shared.country(withCode: "MY")

```

## Styling Options
There are few styling options provided by the library such auto-hiding or styling views.
```swift

let countryController = CountryPickerWithSectionViewController.presentController(on: self) { ... }

// Styling country flag image view
countryController.flagStyle = .corner    // E.g .corner, ,circular or .normal

// Hide flag image view
countryController.isCountryFlagHidden = true // False

// Hide country dial code
countryController.isCountryDialHidden = true  // False

```
